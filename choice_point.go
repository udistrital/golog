// ChoicePoint represents a place in the execution where we had a
// choice between multiple alternatives.  Following a choice point
// is like making one of those choices.
//
// The simplest choice point simply tries to prove some goal; usually
// the body of a clause.  We can imagine more complex choice points.  Perhaps
// when the choice point was created, we spawned a goroutine to investigate
// that portion of the execution tree.  If that "clone" finds something
// interesting, it can send itself down a channel.  In this case, the
// ChoicePoint's Follow() method would just return that speculative, cloned
// machine.  In effect it's saying, "If you want to pursue this execution
// path, don't bother with the computation.  I've already done it"
//
// One can imagine a ChoicePoint implementation which clones the Golog
// machine onto a separate server in a cluster.  Following that choice point
// waits for the other server to finish evaluating its execution branch.
